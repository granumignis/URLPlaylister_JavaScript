This project was an attempt to implement some of the basic functionality of the Python 2 URL Playlister (https://github.com/granumignis/urlplaylister) functionality in JavaScript.

It will display multiple web pages with delays in between each one.

### Program Flow
It Prompts for a URL and associated Duration (in seconds) from the user.<br>
Then, it displays the URL and Duration in the main window<br>
The actual URL's contents are loaded in a seperate window<br>
When the duration for a specific URL has passed, the next URL's content is loaded in the afformentioned seperate window.<br>

A flowchart for this application is included below:

This was submitted as a final in a Programming Fundamentals class at CVTC in 2016
